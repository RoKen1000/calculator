# Overview

This is a calculator written in TypeScript. The calculator interface has been built using React, JSX and CSS. The calculator can perform simple arithmetic as well as more complex calculations while adhering to BIDMAS order of operations. There is an additional section where a record of calculations is kept for reference. 

This has been built using full Test-Driven Development for both the calculator functionality and the React components to test that the calculator displays calculator queries and results correctly. 

It is fully responsive and the viewport shifts depending on the width of the device used.

# Using The Calculator

The calculator buttons can be clicked on or the buttons can be used by tabbing across them and pressing enter to input the desired number or operator on laptop/desktop views. Buttons can be  tapped on mobile views. 

Pressing the equals button clears the calculator query from the display and the calculated answer is displayed in its place.

If the calculator query is valid with no syntax errors, the calculator query is then sent to the calculator history section. 

Malformed queries return an error on the screen. If the query is malformed it is not put into the calculator history.
